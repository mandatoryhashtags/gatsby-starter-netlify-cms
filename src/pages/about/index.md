#### Curtis "MHT" Schrum

### My Fat Guy Credentials
At the time of writing this I weigh 393 pounds or 196.5 kilograms. 28 stone for my UK friends.

I have been overweight or obese most of my life. Though I did not truly become this large until a work from home stint in 2010-2014. The picture does not show it (amazing, right?). That was one of my many attempts at fitness, you know eating right, lots of fruits & vegetables, brown rice, oatmeal, and everything else. I got down to about 330 pounds but I was so tired and miserable I could not maintain it. 

All the while I was a firm believer in the ketogenic lifestyle I just did not do it because, well frankly I have a fondness for chinese food and burritos.
